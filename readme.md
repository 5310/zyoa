Zen Your Own Adventure
======================

ZYOA is a simple little framework for writing branching-narratives in HTML...and some optional Javscript for in-game logic, and CSS for style; since even zen-monks believe in the bare essentials and nothing less.

The framework is nothing but a bunch of Javascript routines that allow for a specially written (but nothing arcane) `article` to "play-back" its contents following a regular manner; jump from one point of the story to another; and then some more to allow for the "branching" bits of branching-narratives. And it also allows for arbitrary chunks of Javascript to be included and run in due course, which allows for a rather large variety of effects, but all to the writer's discretion.

In short, ZYOA aims to do the littlest possible bit of automation to make writing web-based branching-narratives as simple as it should be...but maybe not _simpler_, which sounds like a good fall-back excuse to have.
